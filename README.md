# Data Sourcing: 
Data was captured in an excel file as customers made there order and the sales were closed, this happened largely through one of the stores social media handle, though lately the store launched a website, sales are gradually picking up from there. 
Data of the customers, products and orders were captured in the customers, products and orders table respectively.
Going forward sales data will be exported from the ecommerce website and processed for analysis.

# Data Transformation:
The dataset had to go through a thorough data cleaning process, like we all know human error are most likely in data entry, so there were anomalies in the dataset. Poor date formatting, missing data, outliers to mention a few, were part of the anomalies I had to correct. As for the poor date formatting I had to use the TEXT TO COLUMN option to split the date entry and used the DATE formula to put them in the right format (yyyy-mm-dd).
For the missing data I had to seek clarification from the originators of the data and that helped a lot in filling the missing data with the right ones.
Some outliers were detected after I carried out EDA on some of the metrics using the MIN, MAX function.
I used the VLOOKUP function to flatten the orders table to merge some fields from the customers and products table into the orders table as it is my fact table.
I used the IF and COUNTIFS functions to get the number of repeat customers the business had over the period of one year.
And I was able to also format the fields to the right data type.
